      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For years, Domain Authority (DA) has been the holy grail metric for SEOs looking to <Link to="/buy-guest-posts" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">buy guest posts</Link>. While DA is a useful comparative tool, relying on it exclusively is a dangerous game in 2026. DA can be easily manipulated, and search engines like Google use far more complex signals to evaluate the true value of a backlink.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Domain Authority</h2>
      <p>
        DA is a metric created by Moz that predicts how well a website will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs). It is calculated by evaluating linking root domains, total number of links, and other factors. However, it is a third-party metric—Google does not use DA in its algorithm.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why DA Alone Isn't Enough</h2>
      <p>
        Because DA is based heavily on backlink quantity, it can be artificially inflated using spammy link-building tactics. A site might boast a DA of 60 but have zero organic traffic and a penalized backlink profile. Buying a link on such a site is a waste of money and a risk to your own site's health.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Relevance and Topical Authority</h2>
      <p>
        Relevance is the new DA. A link from a DA 30 blog that is strictly focused on your specific niche is far more valuable than a link from a DA 70 general news site that covers everything from crypto to cooking. Search engines look for topical clusters and semantic relevance between the linking page and your target page.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Traffic Quality and Audience</h2>
      <p>
        A website's organic traffic is the ultimate proof of its health. If Google is sending thousands of visitors to a site every month, it means Google trusts that site. When conducting <Link to="/blogger-outreach" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">blogger outreach</Link>, always prioritize sites with steady, upward-trending organic traffic in your target geographic regions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Engagement Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Look at the site's engagement. Are people commenting on the posts? Are the articles being shared on social media? A vibrant, engaged community indicates a real website run by real people, which is exactly where you want your brand to be featured.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Red Flags Beyond DA</h2>
      <p>
        Watch out for sites with high DA but massive outbound link ratios (sites that link out to hundreds of different domains in every post). Also, beware of sites that have recently changed ownership and completely shifted their content focus—this is a common tactic used by expired domain buyers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Evaluating Real Value</h2>

          <p>Yes, if the site is highly relevant to your niche, has real traffic, and is actively growing. It's better than a spammy DA 50 site.</p>
